# Contributing

At Brainlabs, one of our values is [Collaborate, Don't Compete](https://www.brainlabsdigital.com/about-us-3-2/culture-new/). This document describes our guidelines for collaboration.

## Script Ideas

We would love to hear your script ideas! If you would like to share one please [create an issue](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-an-issue). We can't promise that your ideas will get written, as we have an internal backlog of scripts to write, but it would be great to hear from you.

## Issues

The PPC world changes quickly. Some of our scripts might become obsolete over time (we are all sad to see the end of our [Average Position Bidding Script](Bidding/average-position-bidding.js)).

If you spot anything out of date, please [create an issue](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-an-issue). From there we will investigate and come up with a course of action. We can't promise we'll be able to fix the issue but we will support you contributing to this repository. Please follow the contribution instructions below.
