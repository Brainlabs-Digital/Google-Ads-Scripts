## ad-jective-analysis-tool.js

There was once a time where failed poets did the bulk of advertising copy. Why? Because they knew all the best words. Those days have fled, because now we can measure the value of a word with beautiful data analysis. This script will produce reports on individual words and phrases within your accounts, so you can be objective about your language decisions. Sorry, poets.

## minichecker.js

As much as we might automate, we’re not robots. Even digital marketing superheroes make mistakes once in a while. But forgetting to apply location targeting or getting over-excited on the bid modifier front can get eye-wateringly expensive, fast. Feed this script your chosen upper limits for max CPC and bid modifiers, and it will pull a report detailing all the offending campaigns or keywords in your account. It will also show you instances of worldwide targeting to make sure you’re averting any Google Ads catastrophes.

## search-query-mining-tool.js

Some words, when you put them together, are awesome. Some are not. ‘Free bananas’ sounds good, ‘old bananas’ sounds bad. By appreciating words in the context of other words, we become better search query performance interpreters, and human beings. Use this script to build your ad groups or create your negatives based on phrases rather than individual words.
